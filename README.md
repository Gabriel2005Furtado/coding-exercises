I am doing my exercises using https://play.kotlinlang.org

# 1. 
Create two variables a and b, and initially set them each to a different number. Write a program that swaps both values.
 
 Example: a = 10, b = 20
 
 Output: a = 20, b = 10
 
# 2.
It’s the end of the semester and you got your grades from three classes: Geometry, Algebra, and Physics.
Create a program that:

Reads the grades of these 3 classes (Grades range from 0 - 10)
Calculate the average of your grades

Example: Geometry = 6, Algebra = 7, Physics = 8

Output: average_score = 7

# 3. 
You've bought a Bitcoin and now it's on the rise!!!
Create a program that:

1. Reads the value of the bitcoin at the time of purchase
2. Reads the percentage of increase (or decrease)
3. Prints the total value of your bitcoin
4. Prints the increase or decrease value

• Example: bitcoin_value = 10000, bitcoin_increase = 10
• Output: total_bitcoin_value = 11000, bitcoin_increase_value = 1000

# 4.
You now own some property and you want to calculate the total area of the property.
Create a program that:

1. Reads the width and height
2. Prints the area

• Example: width = 5, height = 2
• Output: total_area = 10

# 5.
This file must be executet from your Terminal pls use this command: 
$java -jar Exercise5.jar

You are interested in buying crypto-currencies. You want to check the current amount of money you have and see how many coins you can buy in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin.
Create a program that:

1. Reads the total amount of money you have
2. Reads the price of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin
3. Prints the amount of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin you can buy

• Example: money = 100, bitcoin_price = 50, ethereum_price = 25, litecoin_price = 10
• Output: "With 100$ you can buy: 2 Bitcoins, 4 Ethereum, and 10 Litecoins"
(Warning! Τhe prices are made up for exercise purposes)

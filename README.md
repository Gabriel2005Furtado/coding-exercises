I am doing my exercises using https://play.kotlinlang.org

# 1. 
Create two variables a and b, and initially set them each to a different number. Write a program that swaps both values.
 
 Example: a = 10, b = 20
 
 Output: a = 20, b = 10
 
# 2.
It’s the end of the semester and you got your grades from three classes: Geometry, Algebra, and Physics.
Create a program that:

Reads the grades of these 3 classes (Grades range from 0 - 10)
Calculate the average of your grades

Example: Geometry = 6, Algebra = 7, Physics = 8

Output: average_score = 7

# 3. 
You've bought a Bitcoin and now it's on the rise!!!
Create a program that:

1. Reads the value of the bitcoin at the time of purchase
2. Reads the percentage of increase (or decrease)
3. Prints the total value of your bitcoin
4. Prints the increase or decrease value

• Example: bitcoin_value = 10000, bitcoin_increase = 10
• Output: total_bitcoin_value = 11000, bitcoin_increase_value = 1000

# 4.
You now own some property and you want to calculate the total area of the property.
Create a program that:

1. Reads the width and height
2. Prints the area

• Example: width = 5, height = 2
• Output: total_area = 10
